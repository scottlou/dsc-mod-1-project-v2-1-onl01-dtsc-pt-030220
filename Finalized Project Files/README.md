Project

Microsoft sees all the big companies creating original video content, and they want to get in on the fun. They have decided to create a new movie studio, but the problem is they donâ€™t know anything about creating movies. They have hired you to help them better understand the movie industry.
Your team is charged with doing data analysis and creating a presentation that explores what type of films are currently doing the best at the box office. You must then translate those findings into actionable insights that the CEO can use when deciding what type of films they should be creating.


The methodology employed included:

* sourcing data from IMDb, Box Office Mojo, and the-numbers.com
* data cleaning using pandas library and scraping using the BeautifulSoup tool from bs4
* data visualization and calculations were done using tools from seaborn, matplotlib, and numpy
* conclusions were drawn, based on the exploratory data analysis completed

Proposed Questions to Answer Included:

1. Which genre should we choose to get the most global reach?
2. Which director/producer has demonstrated the best success in the digital age (2010-) to lead us, and  recruit the best talent?
3. Are there seasonal trends that would suggest when we should release movies or what genres we should focus on in each season to maximize profit?

Conclusions:

1. Genre: Action, Adventure, SciFi (AcAdSci) & Adventure, Animation, Comedy (AdAnCo)
2. Directors: Russo Brothers, or top 20 directors in th etop 3 genres based on worldwide gross in digital age [2010 - ]
